# rainbow-penguin üåà üêß

An npm library to send motivational messages to developers

![Library demo running in Docker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7980624/93638988-924dcf80-f9f8-11ea-91b2-f1b9c7438fca.gif)

## Why?

Coding is a stressful and exhausting task.

The nature of the work requires that we use all our intellectual capacity.

We are constantly challenged, and sometimes we feel lonely.

How cool would it be if your terminal reminded you how important you are? And remind you about how beautiful the work is that you are doing?

Coding is a difficult task and we deserve to be recognized.

Rainbow Penguin is based on the Motivational Penguin gifs and sends you messages to put a smile upon/bring a smile to your face... just to improve your day a little bit üôÉ üåà

## What is it?

It is a simple library that will send you messages in a random interval between 5 and 25 minutes.

The messages will be sent to your terminal.

Below we indicate how to ensure that it is only used in a development environment.

# Installation

```sh
$ npm i rainbow-penguin
```

# Usage

As with most npm libraries, you just need to import it in a file

```js
require('rainbow-penguin')();
```

# Enabling/Disabling

This is a suggestion on how to use only in the development environment.

You can copy and paste these two lines ü•∞

```js
const rainbowPenguin = require('rainbow-penguin');

if (process.env.NODE_ENV == 'development') rainbowPenguin();
```

# Custom

This is a work in progress; soon I hope to be able to add to this feature. Or, if you want to collaborate, it's a library open to collaboration!
